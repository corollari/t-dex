# What?
A cheap cross-chain decentralized exchange

# Why?
Other crosschain exchanges are using:
- Atomic cross-chain swaps (HTLCs...) -> Expensive
- Custodian -> Not trustless

t-dex is both trustless AND cheap (the costs associated with it are the same ones that a centralized exchange has: a transaction to get the funds in and another one to get the funds out). 

# How?
t-dex ports the tokens in a blockchain (BTC, ETH, ERC20...) to another blockchain where the transactions are cheap, creating wrapped versions of those originals tokens in the cheap blockchain in a trustless way. 
Then, these tokens can be exchanged in the cheap blockchain for extremely low fees in decentralized exchanges.
Finally these wrapped tokens can be redeemed for the real thing in their original blockchains.

# HOW? Gimme the juicy details
It uses SPV transaction proofs and XClaim, research developed by a London university.

# Where?
The initial prototype is being built in the DoraHacks hackathon in Beijing, China.
